# What makes a good fuzz target

This document explains the concept of a *fuzz target* and
gives advice on how to make your fuzz targets really good.

# Basics

A *fuzz target* is a function that accepts an array of bytes and does something interesting with these bytes using the API under test.
We define a specific signature for fuzz targets:

```cpp
// fuzz_target.cc
extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  DoSomethingInterestingWithMyAPI(Data, Size);
  return 0;  // Non-zero return values are reserved for future use.
}
```

Note that the interface for this function is C, and so it can be implemented in any programming language that supports C interface.
Despite the name referecing the [LLVM libFuzzer](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html) fuzz targets are
independent from a particular *fuzzing engine* and can be used with fuzzing, symbolic execution, or any other form of testing. 

The basic things to remember about a fuzz target:

* The fuzzing engine will execute it many times with different inputs in the same process.
* It must tolerate any kind of input (empty, huge, malformed, etc).
* It must not `exit()` or `abort()` on any input (if it does, it's a bug).
* It may use threads but ideally all threads should be joined at the end of the function.
* It must be as deterministic as possible. Non-determinism (e.g. random decisions not based on the input bytes) will make fuzzing inefficient.
* It must be fast. Try avoiding cubic or greater complexity, logging, or excessive memory consumption.
* Ideally, it should not modify any global state (although thatâ€™s not strict).
* Usually, the narrower the target the better. E.g. if your target can parse several data formats, split it into several targets, one per format.

More details follow.

# One-time initialization
Sometimes an API under test needs to be initialized.

The simplest and the recommended way is to have a statically initialized global object inside LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput:

```cpp
// fuzz_target.cc
extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  static bool Initialized = DoInitialization();
  ...
```

Or in the global scope if that works for you:

```cpp
// fuzz_target.cc
static bool Initialized = DoInitialization();
extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
  ...
```
